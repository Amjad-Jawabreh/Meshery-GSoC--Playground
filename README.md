# Meshery GSoC Playground by Amjad Jawabreh

This repository is part of my GSoC 2025 journey with the Meshery project, focusing on the **Kubectl Plugin for MeshSync Snapshot**.

I created this space to:
- Document what Iâ€™ve learned
- Track my experiments and progress
- Share my understanding of the Meshery codebase and plugin behavior

---

## âœ… Progress so far:

- Installed Meshery CLI (`mesheryctl`) on Windows
- Ran `mesheryctl system start` successfully
- Cloned the Meshery repo and explored its structure
- Read through plugin-related files (`main.go`, `discovery.go`, `model.go`)
- Asked a technical question on Slack about MeshSync deployment behavior (got feedback from Lee!)

---

## ðŸš€ Next steps:

- Try running the plugin locally and capture dummy snapshot
- Create small test commands using the plugin
- Fork plugin repo and try modifying one behavior
- Summarize learnings and blockers here

---

Stay tuned for more updates ðŸ™Œ
