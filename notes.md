# GSoC 2025 - Day 1 Progress ðŸš€

## âœ… What I accomplished today:

- Forked the repository: `kubectl-meshsync-snapshot`
- Cloned it successfully to my local machine
- Discovered that the repo does not yet contain any Go files
- Created my own `main.go` file inside the project
- Wrote a simple Go program that prints: "Hello from MeshSync Snapshot Plugin!"
- Successfully ran the program using `go run main.go`
- Felt like I took my first real step into the GSoC project
- Created this personal repo `meshery-gsoc-playground` to document and track my progress

## ðŸ§  Observations:

- The plugin project is a skeleton and meant to be built from scratch by contributors
- Iâ€™m starting to understand the structure and purpose of the project better

## ðŸ”œ Next steps:

- Try adding a basic CLI command using Cobra
- Explore other Meshery extensions for structure and inspiration
- Share today's progress with the community on Slack

Every small step is a step forward âœ¨
